This repository contains several basic machine learning projects covering topics spanning supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and basics of reinforcement 
learning. Most projects were motivated by Dr. Sandeep Jain. 

Most code were implemented in Jupyter Notebook. Most are functional; some need further decoration for vectorization and syntax simplification. 

Repository still in construction. More past projects will be uploaded.
